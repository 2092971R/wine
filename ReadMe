This code was writen in the context of a Machine Learning exercise of my Masters course. 

I am investigating a dataset with information about different wines and their chemical properties.
The task was to apply both a supervised and unsupervised learning technique to it and try and extract information.
I use a decision tree classifier and a K means clustering method, plus a genetic algorithm to determine the best 
  attributes of the dataset to be using in both methods.

The report produced is attached.

The files contain the following code;

introduction.py; overview statistics
summary_stats.py; summary statistics
supervised_learning.py; implementation of a decision tree classifier and the confusion maxtrix to present the results
ga_supervised.py; genetic algorithm for determining the best parameters of the dataset to use in the decision tree
unsupervised_learning.py; K means clustering implementation
ga_unsupervised.py; genetic algorithm for determining the best attributes to use in the K means clustering
